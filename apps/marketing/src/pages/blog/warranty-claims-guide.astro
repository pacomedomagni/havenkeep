          How to Never Lose a Warranty Claim Again
        </h1>
        <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Americans throw away $16 billion in unused warranties every year. Here&apos;s the simple system that makes sure you never miss another claim.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">The Hidden Cost of Forgetting</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Think about the last time an appliance broke. Did you know immediately whether it was still under warranty?
          Could you find the receipt? Did you remember where the warranty card was?
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          If you&apos;re like most people, the answer is no. And that moment of uncertainty is costing you real money.
          According to consumer research, the average American household loses approximately <strong class="text-white">$340 per year</strong> 
          to warranties they paid for but never used.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">Why Spreadsheets Don&apos;t Work</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Some organized people try spreadsheets. It works for a week. Then you buy something new, forget to add it,
          and the spreadsheet becomes another abandoned project. The problem isn&apos;t your discipline&mdash;it&apos;s that 
          spreadsheets weren&apos;t designed for this.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          You need a system that takes less effort than doing nothing. That&apos;s the bar. If adding a warranty takes
          more than a few seconds, you won&apos;t do it. If checking your status requires opening a file and scrolling,
          you won&apos;t do it. The system has to come to you.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">The 3-Step System</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Here&apos;s what actually works:
        </p>
        <ol class="text-gray-300 space-y-4 mb-6 list-decimal pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong class="text-white">Capture at the point of purchase.</strong> The moment you buy something,
            scan the barcode or snap a photo of the receipt. This takes 5 seconds and captures everything you need.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="text-white">Let the system track deadlines.</strong> You shouldn&apos;t have to remember
            when warranties expire. Set it and forget it&mdash;literally.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="text-white">Act on reminders, not memory.</strong> When you get a notification that a
            warranty is expiring in 30 days, you have time to inspect the product and file a claim if needed.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">Real Numbers: What This Looks Like</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Let&apos;s say you own 20-30 items with active warranties (most households do). On average, 2-3 of those
          will have issues during their warranty period. If the average repair costs $400-600, that&apos;s 
          <strong class="text-white">$800-$1,800</strong> you could recover simply by filing claims on time.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Contrast that with a warranty tracking tool that costs less than $5/month. The math speaks for itself.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">Getting Started</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The best time to start tracking warranties was when you bought your first appliance. The second best time
          is today. Start with your most expensive items&mdash;electronics, appliances, and anything with a receipt
          you can still find. Work backwards from there.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Most people are surprised to find they have 10+ active warranties they&apos;d completely forgotten about.
        </p>
