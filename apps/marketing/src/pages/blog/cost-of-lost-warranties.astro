            Here's a number that should make you uncomfortable: Americans collectively lose an estimated $16 billion every year in warranty value they already paid for. That's not money spent on warranties—it's money thrown away because people forgot, lost documentation, or simply didn't know they were covered.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">Where Does the Money Go?</h2>
          
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
            When we talk about "lost" warranty value, we're talking about real money leaving real wallets in predictable ways:
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-3">1. The Expired Warranty Repair</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
            Your three-year-old refrigerator stops cooling. You call a repair service, pay $400, and later discover the compressor had a 5-year manufacturer warranty. You were covered—you just didn't know it. This scenario plays out millions of times annually.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-3">2. The Lost Receipt Problem</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
            You know you bought that drill at Home Depot. You're pretty sure it has a 3-year warranty. But without the receipt, the manufacturer won't honor the claim. Thermal paper receipts fade within months. Email receipts get buried. And that warranty becomes worthless.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-3">3. The "I Didn't Know" Factor</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
            Many products have longer warranties than people realize. Your mattress might have a 10-year warranty. Your car battery probably has 3-5 years. Your roof shingles could have 25-50 years. But if you don't know about these warranties, you'll pay out of pocket when problems arise.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-3">4. The Registration Trap</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
            Some warranties require registration within 30-90 days of purchase to be valid. Miss that window, and your coverage might be reduced or eliminated entirely. This is especially common with appliances and HVAC systems.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">The Psychology of Warranty Loss</h2>
          
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
            Why do intelligent people routinely lose money this way? Behavioral economics offers some answers:

              <li>
                <strong class="text-white">Present Bias:</strong> We prioritize immediate tasks over future benefits. Filing that receipt feels unimportant compared to right-now concerns.

                <strong class="text-white">Hyperbolic Discounting:</strong> Future savings feel less valuable than present convenience. The effort of organizing feels bigger than the eventual payoff.

              <li>
                <strong class="text-white">Status Quo Bias:</strong> If we've always ignored warranties, changing that behavior feels like unnecessary effort.

          </div>

          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
            The average household has $20,000-40,000 worth of warrantied items at any given time. If just one major warranty claim gets missed per year, that's $200-500 in unnecessary spending.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">The Compound Effect of Poor Warranty Management</h2>
          
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
            One missed warranty claim isn't catastrophic. But over a lifetime of purchasing, the losses compound:
          </p>

          <ul class="text-gray-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong class="text-white">Age 25-35:</strong> Building a household, lots of new purchases, minimal organization → High missed claim potential</li>
            <li><strong class="text-white">Age 35-50:</strong> Peak earning/spending years, major home purchases, appliance replacements → Highest absolute losses</li>
            <li><strong class="text-white">Age 50+:</strong> More expensive purchases (HVAC, roof), longer ownership periods → Largest individual claim values</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
            Conservative estimates suggest the average person leaves $300-500 on the table annually through warranty mismanagement. Over a 40-year adult life, that's <strong class="text-white">$12,000-20,000</strong> in preventable losses.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">Why This Problem Is Getting Worse</h2>
          
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
            Several trends are making warranty management harder, not easier:
          </p>

          <ul class="text-gray-300 mb-6 space-y-3">
            <li>
              <strong class="text-white">More complex products:</strong> Modern appliances have electronics that fail in ways mechanical ones didn't.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong class="text-white">Shorter lifespans:</strong> Products are designed to be replaced, not repaired—but warranties haven't adjusted.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong class="text-white">Receipt fragmentation:</strong> Purchases spread across online retailers, brick-and-mortar stores, and apps—each with different documentation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong class="text-white">Planned obsolescence:</strong> Products often fail just after warranty expiration (coincidence? manufacturers say yes).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">The Solution Is Simpler Than You Think</h2>
          
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
            The good news: this is an entirely solvable problem. It requires just two things:
          </p>

          <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-primary/20 to-secondary/20 rounded-xl p-8 my-8 border border-primary/30">
            <h4 class="font-bold text-white mb-4">The Two-Part Fix</h4>
            <ol class="text-gray-300 space-y-4 mb-0">
              <li>
                <strong class="text-white">1. Capture at Purchase:</strong> Spend 60 seconds when you buy something to photograph the receipt and log the warranty end date. That's it. The future-you dealing with a broken appliance will thank present-you.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong class="text-white">2. Get Reminded Before Expiration:</strong> Use any system—calendar, app, spreadsheet—that will notify you 30 days before a warranty expires. This gives you time to inspect the product and make any needed claims.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">The Real ROI of Warranty Tracking</h2>
          
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
            Let's be conservative and say proper warranty management prevents just one $350 repair claim every two years. That's $175/year in savings.
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
            The time investment? About 2 minutes per purchase, plus maybe 15 minutes of quarterly maintenance. For a household making 50 notable purchases per year, that's about 100 minutes—less than two hours annually.
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
            That works out to roughly <strong class="text-white">$100/hour</strong> for your time spent organizing warranties. Not many household tasks pay that well.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">Start With What You Have</h2>
          
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
            You can't recover past losses, but you can prevent future ones. Start today:
          </p>

          <ol class="text-gray-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>1. Identify your five most expensive items that are currently under warranty</li>
            <li>2. Locate proof of purchase for each</li>
            <li>3. Note the warranty expiration dates</li>
            <li>4. Set reminders for 30 days before each expiration</li>
          </ol>

          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
            That's 15 minutes that could save you hundreds. The $16 billion lost annually doesn't have to include your money.
